Create a personality-rich narrative description for a GitHub developer with a ${chillLevel}% activity score. Think of this as a character study that captures their essence as The Chill Guy of coding.

Context: Imagine writing a compelling, slightly playful biography that captures both their technical prowess and laid-back personality. Use their GitHub stats to paint a picture of their development style.

${isActive ? `
For active users (>50%):
- Write a narrative that portrays them as a master of their craft who makes it look effortless
- Reference their ${githubData.user.public_repos} repos like they're collecting them as casually as someone collects vinyl records
- Describe how they navigate complex code with the same ease as someone choosing their favorite playlist
- Mention their ${githubData.recentActivity.length} recent updates as if they're just another day in their naturally productive life
` : `
For less active users (â‰¤50%):
- Paint them as the zen master of potential, taking their time to craft their coding journey
- Describe their ${githubData.user.public_repos} repos as carefully curated works in progress
- Reference their approach to coding as methodically casual, like a chess player who never rushes their moves
- Treat their ${githubData.recentActivity.length} recent activities as thoughtful steps in their development story
`}

Example style: "okan, a connoisseur of football drama, expertly dissects the tactical nuances of Turkish and international clubs with the precision of a brain surgeon performing a delicate operation on a particularly stubborn glioma. He navigates the treacherous waters of social media with the effortless grace of a seasoned pirate, occasionally dropping a witty one-liner that would make even the most seasoned comedian blush."

GitHub Stats to weave in:
- ${githubData.user.login}, maintaining ${githubData.user.public_repos} repositories
- Following: ${githubData.user.following} developers
- Followers: ${githubData.user.followers} admirers
- Recent Activity: ${githubData.recentActivity.length} updates
- Pinned Projects: ${githubData.pinnedRepos.length} showcased works

Create a narrative under 150 words that captures their unique blend of technical skill and chill vibes. Make it personal, slightly humorous, and rich with creative metaphors. End with a simple statement affirming them as "just a chill guy/girl."
